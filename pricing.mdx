# Pricing

We price engagements based on scope, timeline, and the rigor required (e.g., production gates, customer commitments, regulated environments). Below are our standard offers. If you’re unsure which one fits, we’ll recommend the smallest thing that produces a defensible decision or a shippable increment.

## Offer catalog

### 1) Decision-to-Spec Discovery (Blueprint)

**Best for:** Teams who need a decision-grade plan before committing to a build (architecture choice, feasibility questions, roadmap bets, system redesign).  
**What you get:** A concise, reviewable blueprint that unblocks build work with clear boundaries and next steps.

* **Includes**
  * Problem framing (what’s being decided, success criteria, constraints)
  * Requirements capture + assumptions log
  * Architecture options analysis with explicit tradeoffs
  * Risks, mitigations, and “what would change our mind” triggers
* **Deliverables**
  * Blueprint package (PDF + editable notes/diagrams)
  * Prioritized backlog + delivery plan
  * Recommendation + next-step plan
* **Timeline:** 1–5 weeks (tier-dependent)
* **Starting at:** **$2,500**

---

### 2) Prototype Sprint (Working Demo)

**Best for:** Proving the critical technical path end-to-end before investing in a full build (integrations, performance unknowns, edge/hardware feasibility, workflow viability).  
**What you get:** A runnable prototype and demo path that de-risks production build work.

* **Includes**
  * Success criteria + demo flow defined at kickoff
  * Targeted validation spikes for the riskiest unknowns
  * Prototype implementation + runnable demo path
  * Known limitations + production hardening recommendations
* **Deliverables**
  * Prototype repo/branch with run instructions
  * Demo script (+ optional short demo video)
  * Findings memo: risks closed, risks remaining, next steps
* **Timeline:** 2–6 weeks (tier-dependent)
* **Starting at:** **$9,500**

---

### 3) Build & Ship Increment (Production Slice)

**Best for:** Shipping a defined product slice with explicit acceptance criteria—without open-ended scope.  
**What you get:** A production-oriented delivery increment with QA gates and release artifacts.

* **Includes**
  * Kickoff scope lock (epics/features defined with acceptance criteria)
  * Implementation with repo hygiene + basic automated checks
  * QA gates + stabilization window (tier-dependent)
  * Release notes + deployment checklist
* **Deliverables**
  * Production code for scoped increment
  * Release package (notes, runbook/ops notes as applicable)
  * Handoff walkthrough + next-increment backlog
* **Timeline:** 4–12 weeks (tier-dependent)
* **Starting at:** **$24,000**

---

### 4) Automation & Integrations Retainer (Monthly Capacity)

**Best for:** Ongoing delivery capacity for APIs, workflows, and operational automation—without open-ended scope.  
**What you get:** A monthly capacity bucket with explicit limits, prioritization, and clear Definition of Done per task.

* **Includes**
  * Monthly planning + prioritization
  * Delivery on approved automation/integration tasks
  * Weekly async status updates (written)
  * Overage option only with written approval
* **Deliverables**
  * Shipped artifacts per task (PRs, scripts, API changes, docs)
  * Monthly recap: shipped items + impact notes
* **Timeline:** Monthly (renewable)
* **Starting at:** **$2,500 / month**

## How we scope

We keep scope small and outcomes explicit. Pricing changes with:

* urgency (compressed timelines),
* depth of evidence/validation required,
* number of stakeholders / systems / environments,
* production rigor (QA gates, release management),
* security/compliance expectations.

If you’re on a deadline, we’ll propose the smallest engagement that produces a defensible outcome.
