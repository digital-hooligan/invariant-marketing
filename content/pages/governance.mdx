# Governance

Scientia is a decision-support platform built by Digital Hooligan LLC.
It combines a governance layer, a context engine, and evidence-first modules to help operators move from signals → context → clarity.
Scientia provides guidance, not autonomous decisions or execution.
Users remain the final decision-makers and operators.
