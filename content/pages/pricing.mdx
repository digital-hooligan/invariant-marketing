# Pricing

We price engagements based on scope, timeline, and the rigor required (e.g., production gates, customer commitments, regulated environments). Below are our standard offers. If you’re unsure which one fits, we’ll recommend the smallest thing that produces a defensible decision or a shippable increment.

## How we scope

We keep scope small and outcomes explicit. Pricing changes with:

- urgency (compressed timelines),
- depth of evidence/validation required,
- number of stakeholders / systems / environments,
- production rigor (QA gates, release management),
- security/compliance expectations.

If you’re on a deadline, we’ll propose the smallest engagement that produces a defensible outcome.
